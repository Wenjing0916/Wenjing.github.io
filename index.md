I'm a <a href="https://med.nyu.edu/departments-institutes/population-health/divisions-sections-centers/biostatistics/" target="_blank"> Biostatistics</a> Ph.D. candidate at <a href="https://www.nyu.edu/" target="_blank"> New York University</a>'s <a href="https://med.nyu.edu/" target="_blank"> Grossman School of Medicine</a>, specifically within the <a href="https://med.nyu.edu/research/sackler-institute-graduate-biomedical-sciences/" target="_blank"> Vilcek institute of Biomedical Sciences</a> and the Department of <a href="https://med.nyu.edu/departments-institutes/population-health/" target="_blank"> Population Health</a>. Under the mentorship of Prof.  
working under the mentorship of Prof.<a href="https://med.nyu.edu/faculty/thaddeus-tarpey" target="_blank"> Thaddeus Tarpey</a>. My research involves developing statistical models that cater to high-dimensional complex data, such as functional and imaging data.

In the summer of 2022, I had the opportunity to work as a Data Scientist Intern at <a href="https://about.google" target="_blank"> Google</a>, where I applied my statistical skills to real-world problems. 
Prior to joining the Ph.D. program, I completed my master's degree in Biostatistics and Data Science from <a href="https://www.cornell.edu" target = "_blank"> Cornell University</a> advised by Prof. <a href= "https://www.idiaz.xyz" target = "_blank"> IvÃ¡n DÃ­az</a>, and my bachelor's degree in International Finance from <a href="https://www.cueb.edu.cn" target = "_blank"> Capital University of Economics and Business</a>. 

Outside of academia, I began my journey as a professional swimmer at the age of 5 and went on to achieve several regional and national championships. I'm also passionate about Chinese calligraphy, and my artwork has been exhibited in top galleries and museums including the <a href="http://www.namoc.org/" target="_blank"> National Art Museum of China (Beijing)</a>. In addition, I am also interested in oil painting, and aeromodelling.

{% include_relative _includes/project1.md %}
-	Utilized multi-sources data, including sociodemographic, natural environment, and built environment factors to examine their impact on Citi Bike usage in New York City on weekdays and weekends in the year 2022.
-	Processed about 13 million trip data using Python, collected a set of 6,744 street view images through Google API, and then employed PSPNet model for semantic segmentation; processed sociodemographic data at Census Block Groups level, Points of Interest data, weather and air quality data using ArcGIS pro.
-	Applied machine learning models to establish non-linear relationships between features and bike-sharing usage at the station scale and reveal the feature importance using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) package in Python.
-	Developed multiscale geographically weighted regression (MGWR) models to capture spatial non-stationary and reveal quantitative effects of related factors at the neighborhood scale.
-	Authored a manuscript published in the *Journal of Transport Geography* as the lead writer, based on research results.

{% include_relative _includes/project2.md %}
-	Utilized the Network Analysis tool in ArcGIS to obtain the 15-minute walking radius for 11 communities in Shanghaiâ€™s five new towns and the central area based on the road network from Open Street Map.
-	Developed a TrueSkill-based rating system to dynamically collect audits of 325 street view images from professional students, and used DeeplabV3 and Mask R-CNN models to extract the physical features in images.
-	Conducted a clustering analysis using PCA and K-means++ algorithms of the perceived walkability scores in 11 communities and explored the characteristics of each cluster.
-	Applied Random Forest feature importance to analyze gender differences in factors influencing walkability perception and assessed the prediction performance of various machine learning models.
-	Authored a manuscript published in the journal *Land* as the lead writer, based on research results.

{% include_relative _includes/project3.md %}
-	Utilized spatial analysis methods such as Kernel Density, Standard Deviational Ellipse, and Spatial Autocorrelation to characterize the spatial and temporal evolution of courier station distribution in 2018 and 2022 at the macro scale.
-	Applied the geographically weighted regression (GWR) model to identify meso-influential factors and models that are "fit for courier stations" and evaluated the supply and demand for street-scale courier station layouts.
-	Analyzed micro-environmental characteristics "fit for courier stations" within 500m buffer zones and proposed an effectiveness evaluation of the current situation based on specific indicators.
-	Built a platform on Datlas system developed by MetroDataTech that integrates data visualization, supply and demand, and performance evaluation for courier station siting services.

{% include_relative _includes/project5.md %}
-	Analyzed the impact of urban sprawl, including the occupation of green spaces and arable land, as well as the growing separation of food production from consumption in the city, through literature review and satellite map comparisons.
-	Suggested a novel urban development framework integrating urban agriculture with the community through three distinct prototypes: agriculture + housing, shopping, and education.
